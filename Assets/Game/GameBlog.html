                    <p>October means it’s time for Battlefest for the loyal Battlefield fans across the globe. . For players of the latest in the series, Battlefield 5, that means all new exclusive skins and weapons tied to timed challenges for players to
                        flex their skills.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p> However , Battlefest is not just a treat for existing players of the game, as Battlefield 5 will be hosting a free weekend event every weekend for the rest of this month, allowing new players to access certain game modes at certain
                        times.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The first test drive is on October 10th-13th
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        allows free weekend players to test the waters on Rush mode. Rush is a classic Battlefield mode that sees players planting and disarming explosives in objective-based games. This trial will also let free weekend players try out the Operation Underground
                        map that was released earlier this month.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The second trial of Battlefest will take place October 17th-20th
                    </h2>
                    <p>shifts focus on the larger infantry-based mode Conquest. Conquest is a staple of the Battlefield series, pitting up to 64 players against each other as two sides try to take control of key points on the map. This weekend will have
                        a limited set of maps available with the aforementioned Operation Underground map with Rotterdam, Devastation, Marita, and Arras in tow.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        The final trial of the month will take place on October 24th-27th
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        offer up the largest multiplayer mode available with Grand Operations. This mode is intended to show multi-day skirmishes in an online mode, with different phases and maps to battle across before determining the winner of the battle. This gives a new
                        experience with every game and offers a robust slice of the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>All of the progress free weekend players accrue over these weekends will apply should they decide to purchase the game at any point. The mode selections are classics and will offer the best at-a-glance view of what Battlefield 5 is at its core. However, it would have been nice to be able to check out the Battle Royale mode, Firestorm, as that has received a lot of hype before the game was released and would likely attract a lot of trial players.

                    <h1>Ubisoft details Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</h1>
                    <p>Attendees at this year’s Microsoft Xbox Press Conference yesterday were treated to a first look at Ubisoft’s next entry into the Tom Clancy’s The Division franchise. However, the folks over at <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2" alt="Tom Clancy 2">Ubisoft's</a> saved the juicy bits for their own press conference that took place earlier today. </p>
                    <p>The awesome video above goes into great detail about what you will be able to expect from Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. This new game is set seven months after a deadly virus was released in New York City, and will bring players into a fractured and collapsing Washington D.C. The world is on the brink, its people living through the biggest crisis ever faced in human history.</p> 
                    <img src="https://technewsiit.com/sites/default/files/2019-03/division-2-story-trailerjpgoptimal.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Tom Clancy 2">
                    <p>As veteran Division agents, players are the last hope against the complete fall of society as enemy factions vie for control of the city. If Washington DC is lost, the entire nation falls. </p>
                    <p>Developed on an updated version of the Snowdrop Engine, Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 will be releasing worldwide on March 15, 2019, on the Xbox One family of devices including the Xbox One, and also PS4 and PC.

                        If you would like to get your hands on the game early and help Ubisoft craft an enjoyable experience, you can register for beta access now for a chance to play at <a href="http://thedivisiongame.com/beta" class="link-primary">Ubisoft's</a>.</p>
                    <h1>The Tomb Raider Reboot Trilogy Is Currently Free On PC</h1>
                    <h4>Epic is offering Tomb Raider, Rise of The Tomb Raider, and Shadow of The Tomb Raider for free until Jan 6</h4>
                    <p>Christmas may be over, but the Epic Games Store isn’t done handing out free gifts just yet. Its latest free game is actually <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale">three free games in one</a>. Until January 6, you can head over there and grab the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, its 2016 sequel Rise of The Tomb Raider, and its 2019 follow-up, Shadow of The Tomb Raider, for free. That’s a lotta tomb raidin’!
                        <br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_965/2a28790ae9fa5bcfd6c70871b12623dd.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Tomb Raider"> 
                        This isn’t a complete surprise. Like kids peeking under the Christmas tree while their parents are asleep,<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/epic-free-game"> a few days ago dataminers and leakers</a> had already revealed that folks would be getting some free Tomb Raider games on Dec. 30. And, they were right! Just a short time ago, the Survival Trilogy popped up <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/free-games">as today’s free giveaway on the Epic Games Store</a>. As usual, you’ll need to download the Epic Games Store launcher on PC, create an account if you don’t have one already, and then add the free games to your library before the giveaway ends on January 6, 2022..</p>
                    <p>If you haven’t played any of the newer Tomb Raider games, you should definitely try to play these during any free holiday time you might have left in 2021. The first game in the trilogy, confusingly named just <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-the-kotaku-review-5986619">Tomb Raider</a>, shakes up the franchise formula, focusing more on survival and open-world-like exploration. There’s also a crafting system and as you progress through the game’s action-movie storyline you unlock upgrades for your gear and abilities.</p>
