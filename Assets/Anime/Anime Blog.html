                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">WHY DID EREN TURNED EVIL?</h2>
                   
                    <p>Eren Jaeger from Attack On Titan has one of the darkest character developments throughout the series. As the series comes to an end, fans are looking back at their favorite anime lead’s past. Eren went through a series of horrific events and did not move on or take a lesson from any of them. This particular detail is seen in his current actions as well. From his desire to join Survey Corps to becoming a mass murderer, Eren has changed drastically. Now, what really is the cause of it? Why Did Eren Jaeger Turn Evil? Lastly, was he ever good to begin with?

                        Undeniably, Eren is an interesting character. The series begins with one of the biggest causes of Eren’s growth, the loss of his mother. Ever since his birth, Eren had hated Titans, but Carla’s death is the leading cause for him to loathe the creatures. Initially, Eren saw the Survey Corps and dreamt of fighting Titans. However, this incident brought him closer to the gripping reality. However, this is not it, and there has been an event before this that shows Eren’s true self.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To answer this question, we must go back to the original source material. A recent chapter of the manga features a segment where Mikasa questions if she ever knew the true self of Eren or just a side of him. Eren saved Mikasa from the killers of her parents at the time where she had lost all hopes. He offers her a red scarf that is still placed on her neck. Mikasa thought that Eren’s advance on Marley that kills innocents along his way is a consequence of being controlled and not his willing actions.

                        However, the saying that ‘Eren has changed’ may not be accurate. Eren never changed, and his true goals are finally forming a shape. Eren loves his family and friends and his nation Paradis, and now his love has gone to the point of destroying the reason behind their problems. Hence, now Eren has a plan chalked out for his worst enemies. However, he leads on to be the final antagonist.

                    <p>The Netflix Anime YouTube account released a "Translator's Notes" video last Thursday explaining the Japanese language puns for the following character names featured in the Komi Can't Communicate anime: Shoko Komi, Hitohito Tadano, Agari Ueno, Ren Yamai, Najimi Osana, and Makeru Yadano.The anime premiered on TV Tokyo and other channels on October 6 at 12:00 a.m (effectively, October 7). The anime started streaming exclusively on Netflix in Japan on October 7. Netflix debuted the anime outside of Japan on October 21, two weeks after its Japanese premiere, with weekly new episodes. Netflix is streaming the anime in over 190 countries and territories in eight languages dubbed and 31 languages subtitled.

                        Shortly after the anime's global debut, fans criticized the English subtitles for not translating parts of Tadano and Komi's blackboard conversation in episode 1.
